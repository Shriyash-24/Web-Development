<h1>Heading Tag</h1>
<p>Heading tag is used to create a heading of a web page. It varies from h1 to h6. You may think it's based on font size but that's not true, we can change font size using CSS. The main thing is about the emphasis on the hierarchy of the web page. The h1 being the most important and h6 being the least. Headings are used to achieve a clear and logical structure.h1 tag should be used for SEO. 1 Webpage should contain 1 h1 tag only. Also, h1 ke baad h2 ka use karna, h3 ka nahi.</p><hr>
