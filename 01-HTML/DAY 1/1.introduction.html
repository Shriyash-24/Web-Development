<h1>HTML - Hyper Text MarkUp Language</h1>

<h2>History About html</h2>
<p>In 1990's, we needed to remember the url of the website to visit the webpage. The problem soon arised about how could I remember so many URL's? Then Hyperlink concept was introduced. Let's say I have a website named apple so then I could add reference to banana web page and so on and these would be called HyperLinks.The HT in HTML stands for Hyper Text because of this reason.</p><hr>
<p>The M in HTML stands for MarkUp. It means to focus on a specific keyword. So let's say I have a html code and I have to host it. So one way would be to host on a server but this would be a long process because I am still fixing and writing the code. So, instead I host it to my own machine. It is hosted on to this IP address - http://127.0.0.1:/Port No/index.html. This address is known as Loop Back address.Then web browsers can read html files easily.</p>
