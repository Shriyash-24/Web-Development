<h1>Absolute And Relative Paths</h1>
<p>Let's say I am in dwarka and there is one person which wants address from me to cannaught place. Now, I can tell him go to shadipur and then C.P will come. This will be an example of a relative path. Or I can tell him that there is India --> Delhi --> New Delhi --> Rajouri Garden --> C.P. which is an example of absolute path. Pls refer to the image to understand in depth about this - <hr>
