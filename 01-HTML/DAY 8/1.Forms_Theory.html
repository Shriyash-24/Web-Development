    <h1>Forms</h1><hr>
    <p>To create forms in HTML, we will be be first introduced to the form tag. Now form tag will contain action, this action describes where our form data will be sent and we can also add an attribute named method. We can set it's value as post if we are posting the form or get if we want to derive information.
    </p>
    <p>To take input from user, use the input tag. It will contain type, so in that you can set different values such as text,number,tel,email, radio etc. It also contains name attribute, it will define you that whatever you set here will be sent to the backend with that thing. For eg - name="fname" so, here user may enter 'Shyam' now in backend this will be stored as fname="Shyam" like this.</p>
    <p>There is also a value attribute, so this 'Shyam' gets stored as Shyam and that will go to the backend.</p>
    <p>Label tag is generally used before input tag. This gives a label to your input. There is something named for attribute in label, let's say I give for="age" there and also in input tag i give id="age" now these two will be connected. If I click on Age label it will take me to the input directly. There is also a placeholder attribute which you can use in input tag. It will keep that written in the box until the user starts typing.</p><hr>
    <p>We know that we could radio type in input. You can make them like you already do, just make sure of all options you provide the name would be same if you want one value to be selected.</p><hr>
    <p>Now if you want to give a big message box as the input just make sure you use textarea instead of input. You can define rows and columns there also. </p><hr>
    <p>If you want to make a dropdown menu, you just create select tag instead of input. And in that you can make you of option tag. Add multiple options there. Let's say there is a option which i don't want my user to select so just use disabled selected as the attribute and that won't happen.</p><hr>
    <p>If you want to create different sections in the form use fieldset and inside that use legend as your section title.</p><hr>
