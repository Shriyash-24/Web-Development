<h1>Why Absolute Path Doesn't Work?</h1>
<p>So when I am using a image tag, i need to provide a source. I can provide an absolute path of the image or a relative path. Absolute path hold complete path to the image. So, to access that image servers need to access my root directory, and because the servers has access to my root directory they can take anything from my computer. So, for security reasons the absolute path deos not work.
Root directory is the folder which contains all the files.
