<h1>How Images Will Be Stored?</h1>
<p>
    <img src="pixel-eye-E7PMEW.jpg" height="300" width="400" alt="pixelated image"> <hr>
    So, let's say this image contains 10000 pixels. So, total pixels would be 10000 pixels. It will also store each colour of the pixel. I can make any colour using RGB. I can put values between 0-255 ( 8 bits ) in each section. So it becomes 8-8-8 so 24 bits i.e 3 bytes. So, total size will be 10000*3 = 30000 bytes or 30KB. 
    For more clarity, R,G,B are stored in 48 bits instead. <hr>
